Overview

This project is a high-fidelity implementation of the Kilangi Jewellery homepage, built as part of an internship assignment. The goal was to translate the provided desktop and mobile design documents into a responsive, production-quality web page while maintaining strong attention to visual accuracy, layout consistency, and code quality.

The implementation focuses on matching the design intent, typography hierarchy, spacing, and responsive behavior shown in the provided designs, while keeping the codebase clean, readable, and maintainable.

Design Approach

The layout and content hierarchy closely follow the provided Desktop and Mobile PDFs.

Typography is matched visually using Playfair Display for headings and Inter for body text.

Spacing, section separation, and visual weight are handled carefully to preserve the premium, minimal aesthetic of the brand.

Desktop and mobile layouts are implemented explicitly using media queries rather than relying on automatic scaling.

The objective was to make the final output visually indistinguishable to the human eye from the reference designs.

Features Implemented

Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile screens

Clear typographic hierarchy and consistent spacing

Hero section with strong visual emphasis

Product cards with pricing and hover interactions

Horizontally scrollable product section on mobile

Brand ethos section with image and content balance

Subtle hover and scroll-based animations

Mobile navigation toggle with accessibility attributes

Technologies Used

HTML5 for semantic structure

CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries) for layout and responsiveness

Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and scroll animations

Google Fonts (Playfair Display, Inter)

Internet-hosted images via Unsplash (no local assets required)

No frameworks or third-party libraries were used.

Responsiveness

Desktop layout matches the desktop design document.

Mobile layout matches the mobile design document with intentional layout changes:

Stacked hero section

Horizontal scrolling product cards

Simplified navigation

Smooth transitions between breakpoints ensure usability across common screen sizes.

Code Quality & Practices

Clean, semantic HTML structure

Modular and readable CSS with consistent naming

Minimal, purposeful JavaScript

Separation of concerns between structure, styling, and behavior

Accessibility considerations such as ARIA attributes and lazy-loaded images

Notes

This project prioritizes design accuracy, clarity, and maintainability over unnecessary complexity. The implementation reflects real-world frontend practices expected at an internship level, with careful restraint in interactivity and logic.
